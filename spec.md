## Summary
**Goal:** Make the logout button clearly visible by applying dark color styling in the navigation bar.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the logout button/link in the Header component to use dark color styling for strong contrast against the navigation bar background
- Apply consistent dark color styling to the logout option in both desktop and mobile nav layouts

**User-visible outcome:** The logout button is clearly visible and easy to locate in the navigation bar on both desktop and mobile views.
