# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Full premium UI redesign of the entire frontend — landing page, admin dashboard, and student portal — using a consistent deep navy, white, and gold design system without changing any functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Define global CSS custom properties for deep navy (#0B1B3E), white, and gold (#C9A84C); apply Playfair Display for headings and Inter for body text throughout the app
- Redesign Hero section with a mathematics-themed background (subtle low-opacity math symbols as SVG/CSS decorations), improved layout balance, and gold-accented CTA buttons
- Redesign Header with clean sticky nav, no empty boxes, consistent spacing, gold/navy brand colors, and a functional mobile menu
- Redesign Services, EnrollmentCTA, and Footer sections with premium card layouts (soft shadows, rounded corners, gold accents) and consistent button styles
- Redesign Admin Dashboard and all child tab components with a deep navy sidebar, gold active-state indicators, white card content areas, and improved table/form styling
- Redesign Student Portal and all child views with gold underline tab indicators, white content cards, gold-accented progress/attendance bars, and premium form styling
- Redesign all modal and dialog components (booking flow, login, enquiry forms) with navy headers, gold accents, clean form fields with gold focus rings, and premium confirmation screens

**User-visible outcome:** The entire app — landing page, admin dashboard, and student portal — presents a cohesive, premium mathematics education brand with deep navy, white, and gold styling, improved typography hierarchy, and polished UI components, while all existing functionality remains fully operational.
