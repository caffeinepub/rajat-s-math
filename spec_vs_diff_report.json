  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested meeting link functionality. REQ-1 backend types and migration are present. REQ-2 admin UI in StudentDetailView includes the meeting platform selector, URL input, edit/delete actions. REQ-3 student-facing 'Join Class' button appears in StudentDashboard. However, several specific acceptance criteria require closer examination — notably the confirmation dialog before deleting a meeting link, backend functions being explicitly visible, and whether StudentScheduleTab also shows the 'Join Class' button.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Backend public functions to add, update, and delete the meeting link on an existing session must be exposed. The hooks useAddOrUpdateMeetingLink and useRemoveMeetingLink are imported in StudentDetailView, but the actual backend actor functions are not visible in the truncated backend/main.mo.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated before the meeting link CRUD functions would appear, so their presence cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "StudentScheduleTab is listed as a modified file but its diff was omitted due to file limits. It is unknown whether the 'Join Class' button was added there.",
