  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive premium UI redesign covering the global design system, Hero, Header, landing page sections, Admin Dashboard (partial), and several child components. REQ-1 through REQ-5 are largely addressed. However, REQ-6 (Student Portal and all child views) and REQ-7 (modal/dialog components) show no direct file changes in the diff, making their implementation unverifiable. The image requirement (hero-math-bg.dim_1920x900.png) is referenced in Hero.tsx but no image file was added.",
