  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features: a Header component with Login/Logout buttons, post-login redirect logic, admin route guards, and admin-only UI elements. However, there is no evidence that the backend's isAdmin function was updated with the correct admin principal ID for rkj.jain2204@gmail.com (REQ-4). The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and does not show any changes to an admin principal constant. Additionally, a separate LoginButton component was created that duplicates auth logic already present in the Header.",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and shows no changes to an admin principal constant or isAdmin function. There is no evidence that the hardcoded principal ID was updated or verified to match rkj.jain2204@gmail.com's Internet Identity principal.",
