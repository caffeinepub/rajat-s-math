  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 is addressed via UpiPaymentStep (discount code input, real-time price calculation, backend validateDiscountCode call, error handling), BookingFlowManager (passing discount data through submission payload), BookingConfirmation (showing discount code and discounted amount), and useQueries.ts (useValidateDiscountCode hook). REQ-2 is addressed via index.css (comprehensive CSS rules forcing opaque backgrounds on all Radix UI dropdown/select/popover/context-menu/menubar/navigation-menu content in both light and dark modes, plus booking dialog opaque background). No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were detected.",
