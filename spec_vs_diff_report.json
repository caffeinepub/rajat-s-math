  "summary": "The diff modifies Header.tsx and LoginButton.tsx to revert logout button styling. LoginButton.tsx explicitly reverts to lighter gray styling (bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 text-gray-800) as required. Header.tsx is modified but truncated, so the desktop and mobile logout button styling changes cannot be fully verified. The file summaries confirm the intent aligns with REQ-1. No hallucinated features are evident.",
